Explain the difference between the = operator and the == operator in Python
Operator =
  Definition: '=' is called as assignment operator which is used to assign the value to the variable
  usage : when we use '=' we are telling to python to store the value on the right side in the variable on the left side
  Example: """
age =24
print(age)
"""
  so here we store the value on right side(24) in the variable on the left side(age)
Operator '=='
 Definition: '==' this operator called as equality operator which is used to compared two values its determine if two value are equal.
 usage : when we use '==' we are telling to python to check whether the value are same in both side if its 'True' then the value  are same if 'False' then the value are not same
 Example:
"""
x=1
y=1
z=2
print(x == y)
print(x == z)
"""
